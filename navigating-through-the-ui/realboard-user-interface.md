<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/1 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The RealBoard interface is designed to provide an intuitive and organized user experience. Below is a guide to understanding the various elements of the UI, starting from the left side and moving across the screen.

## 1. Board Information

At the top left of the screen, you will find key information about the board you are viewing:

* **Created By**: Displays the name of the person who created the board.
* **Created On**: Shows the date when the board was created.
* **Board Title**: In bold, the title of the board is displayed (e.g., "Born in a country where the marriage age is the lowest").
* **Total Sections**: In brackets next to the board title, you can see the total number of sections within the board.

## 2. Search Bar

To the right of the board title, you will see a **Search Bar**. This allows you to search for specific text, card names, keywords, or other content within the board. It helps you quickly locate information without manually browsing through the sections.

## 3. Notification Icon

Next to the search bar, you will find the **Notification Icon**. This icon alerts you to any new notifications, such as comments on your posts, updates from teachers, or new assignments.  A red dot will indicate when you have unread notifications.

## 4. Language Change Icon

The **Language Change Icon** allows you to switch the interface language. Currently, RealBoard supports three languages:

* **English**
* **Swedish**
* **Korean**

You can change the language at any time by clicking the icon and selecting your preferred language.

## 5. Minimize/Maximize Icon

To the right of the language icon, there is the **Minimize/Maximize Icon**. This allows you to toggle the size of the interface window, letting you work in a more compact view or expand it for better visibility of all sections and cards.

## 6. User Profile

On the far right of the top bar, there is a **User Profile Circle**. This displays your profile picture and username. Clicking on this will give you access to your account settings and profile options.

## 7. Home Button

Below the top bar, on the left, you will find the **Home Button**. Clicking this will take you to the main RealBoard homepage, where you can view and access all of your boards.

## 8. Filter Options

Next to the Home button is the **Filter Icon**, which provides two types of filters to help you sort and find relevant content on the board:

1. **Common Filter**:
   * **Most Commented Card**: Sorts the cards in the board by the number of comments.
   * **Most Reacted Card**: Sorts the cards based on the number of reactions.
2. **Filter by User**:
   * Allows you to filter and view the cards and sections posted by specific users in the board.

## 9. Students and teachers invite Button

To the right of the filters, there is the **Invite Button**, which allows you to invite other students and teachers within your school to join the board. When inviting them, you can assign them one of the following privileges:

* **Read Only**: The student/teacher can view the board and cards but cannot make changes or post new content.
* **Write Only**: The student/teachercan post cards and make changes but cannot access admin-level settings.
* **Admin**: The student/teacher has full control over the board, including adding sections, managing users, and modifying settings.

## 10. Add Section Icon

Finally, on the far right, youâ€™ll find the **Add Section Icon**. Clicking this allows you to create a new section within the board. Sections help organize the board by topic, making it easier for students to post relevant content and for teachers to manage assignments.
