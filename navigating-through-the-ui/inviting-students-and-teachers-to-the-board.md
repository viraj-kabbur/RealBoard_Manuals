# Inviting Students and Teachers to the Board

To the right of the filters, there is the **User Invite Button**, which allows you to invite other students and teachers within your school to join the board. This feature is useful for teachers who want to bring additional students or collaborators into the board, or for students who want to collaborate with their classmates.

## Steps to Invite a User

1. **Click the Invite Button**: Locate and click on the **User Invite Button** (next to the filter icon).
2. **Enter User Details**: In the invitation window, enter the name or email address of the user you want to invite.
3. **Assign Privileges**: Choose one of the following privilege levels for the invited user:
   * **Admin**: The student/teacher has full control over the board, including managing sections, adding users, and changing settings.
   * **Write Only**: The student/teacher can add and modify cards but cannot manage sections or users.
   * **Read Only**: The student/teacher  can view the board and its contents but cannot post cards or make changes.
4. **Send Invitation**: Once you have assigned the privileges, click **Send Invitation**.

## What Happens Next?

After sending the invitation, the invited student/teacher will receive a **notification** in RealBoard. In the notification, they will see the details of the board they are being invited to, along with the privilege level assigned to them. The student/teacher can then either:

* **Accept the Invitation**: Once accepted, the student/teacher is granted access to the board with the specified privileges.
* **Decline the Invitation**: If they choose to decline, they will not be added to the board, and the invitation will be removed.
