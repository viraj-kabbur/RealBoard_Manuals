# Inviting Users to the Board

To the right of the filters, there is the **User Invite Button**, which allows you to invite other users within your school to join the board. This feature is useful for teachers who want to bring additional students or collaborators into the board, or for students who want to collaborate with their classmates.

## Steps to Invite a User

1. **Click the Invite Button**: Locate and click on the **User Invite Button** (next to the filter icon).
2. **Enter User Details**: In the invitation window, enter the name or email address of the user you want to invite.
3. **Assign Privileges**: Choose one of the following privilege levels for the invited user:
   - **Read Only**: The user can view the board and its contents but cannot post cards or make changes.
   - **Write Only**: The user can add and modify cards but cannot manage sections or users.
   - **Admin**: The user has full control over the board, including managing sections, adding users, and changing settings.
4. **Send Invitation**: Once you have assigned the privileges, click **Send Invitation**.

## What Happens Next?

After sending the invitation, the invited user will receive a **notification** in RealBoard. In the notification, they will see the details of the board they are being invited to, along with the privilege level assigned to them. The user can then either:

- **Accept the Invitation**: Once accepted, the user is granted access to the board with the specified privileges.
- **Decline the Invitation**: If they choose to decline, they will not be added to the board, and the invitation will be removed.

## Managing Invited Users

If you are the board admin, you can view and manage the list of invited users from the board's settings. This includes:
- Revoking invitations that have not been accepted.
- Changing user privileges (e.g., upgrading a user from "Read Only" to "Admin").

By using the **Invite User** functionality, you can easily bring collaborators into your RealBoard workspace and control their level of access based on the needs of the project.
