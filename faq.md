To access RealBoard from within RealLives:

1. **Log in** to RealLives and start your gameplay.
2. Look for the **RealBoard** button on your dashboard or during gameplay.
3. **Click** the RealBoard button to open the interface. You’ll have three options:
   * Add a card with a screenshot
   * Add a card without a screenshot

### 2. What are my options when I click the RealBoard button?

When you click the **RealBoard** button in RealLives, you are presented with three options:

1. **Add Card with Screenshot**: You can capture a screenshot from the game and post it to RealBoard.
2. **Add Card without Screenshot**: You can post a card without attaching a screenshot.
3. **Go to RealBoard Home**: You can return to the main RealBoard page where all your boards, cards, and assignments are organized.

### 3. How do I create a card with or without a screenshot?

After clicking **Add Card with Screenshot** or **Add Card without Screenshot**, you will need to:

1. **Select a Section**: Choose which section in the board you want to post to. Each section corresponds to different topics or assignments.
2. **Provide a Title**: Enter a descriptive title for your card.
3. **Write a Description**: Provide a detailed explanation or reflection related to your gameplay.
4. **Attach Media (Optional)**: You can add media such as images, videos, or documents.
5. **Tag SDGs**: Select up to two **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** that are relevant to your post.
6. **Submit the Card**: Click **Add to RealBoard** to post your card to the board.

### 4. What are Sections in RealBoard?

**Sections** are categories within a board that organize your cards by topic or assignment. Teachers create these sections based on the objectives of the class. When you post a card, you’ll choose the section that best fits your post.

For example, a section could be called **"Personal Reflection"** or **"About the Country"** and is where you’ll post your work related to that topic.

### 5. What are Cards?

**Cards** are individual tiles in RealBoard where you post your work or reflections. Each card can include a title, description, media (such as screenshots), and SDG tags. Cards are submitted within the relevant sections of a board.

### 6. What are SDGs and why do I need to tag them?

**SDGs** stand for **Sustainable Development Goals**, which are a set of 17 global goals designed by the United Nations to promote sustainability. When you create a card, you can select **up to two SDGs** that relate to the content of your card.

For example, if your gameplay involves discussing health issues in a country, you might tag **Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being**.

### 7. How do I know which board I’m posting to?

When creating a card, you will see the **Board Name** at the top of the card creation window. This tells you which class or assignment the board is connected to. Your teacher sets up the board when they create an assignment in RealBoard.

### 8. How can I see my total number of posts or cards?

While you are creating or viewing a card, you will see the **Total Number of Cards** posted by you in that class or assignment. This helps you keep track of your progress.

### 9. What if I can’t upload a screenshot or media file?

If you’re having trouble uploading a screenshot or media file, check the following:

* Ensure the file is the correct format (e.g., .jpg, .png for images, .mp4 for videos).
* Check the file size; large files may not upload easily.
* Verify your internet connection is stable.

If issues persist, contact support or your teacher for help.
