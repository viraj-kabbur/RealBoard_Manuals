# Creating Cards

In RealBoard, **Cards** are individual tiles within a Section where students can document and share their work, reflections, and other relevant content. Each card represents a discrete piece of work or an individual entry related to the assignments and activities in the section.

## Purpose of Cards

Cards serve several important functions:

1. **Showcase Work:** Allow students to present their completed assignments, projects, or reflections in a structured and accessible format.
2. **Encourage Reflection:** Provide a space for students to share their thoughts, insights, and experiences related to their tasks or learning process.
3. **Facilitate Interaction:** Enable teachers/professors and peers to view, comment on, and provide feedback on the student’s work.&#x20;

## Key Features of Cards

1. **Title and Description:** Each card has a **Title** and **Description**. The title briefly identifies the content of the card, while the description provides more detailed information.
2. **Attachments:** Cards can include various relevant attachments such as **Screenshots**, **Files**, or **Links** relevant to the content.
3. **Comments and Feedback:** Cards may have a section for comments where teachers/professors and peers can provide feedback or ask questions.
4. **Stars**: Teachers/Professors can rate a card out of 5 stars based on the creativity of the card.
5. **Reactions**: Students and teachers/professors can react on cards with the help of emojis.

In RealBoard, we’ve included a set of emojis for reactions to help users quickly express their thoughts and feelings about a post. These emojis— 👍 (Like), ❤️ (Love), 😂 (Funny), 😲 (Surprised), 😢 (Sad), and 😡 (Angry)— offer a range of emotional responses, allowing for a more interactive and engaging experience. By using reactions, students and teachers/professors can easily provide feedback or acknowledge a post without needing to leave a comment, making interaction faster and more fun.

## Examples of Card Usage

* **Assignment Submission Card:** A student submits their completed assignment by creating a card with a title like “Research Paper on Climate Change,” a description summarizing the content, and an attachment of the completed paper.

Cards provide a flexible and organized way for students to present their work and for teachers/professors to review and provide feedback. They are an essential component of the RealBoard platform, helping to manage and display student contributions effectively.
