## Why We Use These Six Default Sections

In RealBoard, we have included six default sections to help both teachers and students organize content effectively and promote a more structured approach to assignments. Each section is designed to target specific aspects of a student’s learning experience, encouraging deep reflection, analysis, and understanding.

While these sections are provided by default, **you can edit them** here during the class creation process or later in RealBoard. Additionally, once inside RealBoard, **you have the flexibility to add new sections** that better fit your specific class or assignment needs.

Below is an explanation of each default section:

#### 1. **About the Country**

This section encourages students to explore and share important facts about their character's country of birth. It helps them research key details such as the nation’s culture, history, economy, and geography. This section is essential for building a foundational understanding of the social and cultural environment of the character’s life.

#### 2. **Personal Reflection**

Personal growth and self-awareness are crucial parts of education. This section prompts students to reflect on their personal experiences in the game, especially how certain life events have impacted their character’s journey. By writing about these reflections, students can connect their in-game experiences with real-world lessons, fostering emotional intelligence and critical thinking.

#### 3. **Challenges Faced by My Family**

This section helps students examine the difficulties their character’s family has encountered. It pushes students to think about real-world social and economic challenges that affect families, encouraging them to reflect on resilience, perseverance, and the support systems that help individuals overcome adversity.

#### 4. **SDG Challenges**

This section connects students’ experiences to the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. It allows them to discuss how global issues such as poverty, health, education, and climate action are reflected in the character’s life and community. The section emphasizes the importance of local and global actions to achieve SDGs.

#### 5. **Empathy Values**

Empathy is an important value in global citizenship. This section focuses on helping students understand and practice empathy, both within the context of the game and in real life. Students share stories where they or their character showed empathy, discuss the importance of understanding others' perspectives, and highlight ways to practice empathy in their communities.

#### 6. **Events Which Bothered Me**

This section encourages students to discuss and reflect on events that troubled them during the game. It provides a space to share how certain situations affected them emotionally and mentally, and how they dealt with these challenges. By reflecting on these experiences, students can learn to better understand their emotions and develop coping strategies.
