### 1. Adding a Card with or without Screenshot

Whether you choose to add a card with or without a screenshot, the following fields and features are common:

#### Common Fields and Features:

* **Board Name**: The name of the board associated with your class is displayed at the top of the card creation window. This helps you keep track of which assignment you are working on.
* **Character Attributes**: The name, age, gender of your current character in RealLives will also be displayed. This connects the actions you take in RealLives with the card you are posting on RealBoard.
* **Section Name**: You can choose which section of the board to post your card in. The section names are pre-determined by your teacher/professor (e.g., "About the Country"). You will also see the total number of cards already posted in that section. (0), (1),...
* **Total Number of Cards**: You can view the total number of cards you have already posted in the class, helping you track your progress.

#### If you choose to add a screenshot, you get the option of cropping the screenshot to highlight only the important information in your card

#### Card Fields:

* **Card Title**: Enter a descriptive title for your card. The title should reflect the content or main idea of your post (e.g., “Born in a Country with the Lowest Marriage Age”).
* **Card Description**: This is where you provide a more detailed explanation of your post. You can format the description with bold, italics, or underline text, and you can also include lists.
*   **Add Media**: You have the option to attach relevant media from various categories, including:

    * **Image** (e.g., a reference image you would like to show)
    * **Video**
    * **Document** (e.g., a written report or reflection)

    You can only add **one media item per category** to your card.

#### Tag SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals): <mark style="background-color:red;">Maximum 2</mark>

* **Select Two SDGs**: You will be asked to select up to two relevant **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** from the list of 17. These should align with the theme of your post. The SDGs include goals like **No Poverty**, **Quality Education**, and **Climate Action**.

#### Posting the Card:

* Once you have filled out all the required fields (title, description, media, and SDGs), click the **Add to RealBoard** button to post your card.
* Your card will be visible to your teacher/professor and classmates, and will be part of the board associated with your class.
