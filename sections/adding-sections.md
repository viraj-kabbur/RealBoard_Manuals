# Sections

In RealBoard, **Sections** are components within a Board that help categorize and organize content related to assignments, projects, or topics. Each board can contain multiple sections, each serving a specific purpose or focus area.

## Purpose of Sections

Sections are designed to:

1. **Categorize Content:** Organize different types of content or aspects of an assignment into distinct areas for better clarity and management.
2. **Enhance Organization:** Allow for a structured layout within a board, making it easier for students to find and work on specific tasks or assignments.
3. **Facilitate Specific Goals:** Target different types of activities or reflections, such as project milestones, personal reflections, or SDG challenges.

## Key Features of Sections

1. **Title and Type:** Each section has a **Title** and a **Type**. The title describes the focus of the section, and the type determines the nature of content it holds.
2. **Types of Sections:**
   - **SDG Challenges:** Sections focused on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where students can work on related challenges and document their progress.
   - **Personal Reflection:** Sections where students reflect on their learning experiences, share insights, and discuss their personal growth.
   - **Custom Sections:** Teachers can create custom sections to fit specific needs or assignments, such as group projects, research topics, or skill development.

## How to Add a Section

1. **Open Board:** Navigate to the board where you want to add a section.
2. **Add Section:** Click on the **Add Section** button.
3. **Enter Section Details:**

4. **Save:** Click **Add** to include the section in the board.

## Managing Sections

- **Edit:** Modify the title or type of an existing section.
- **Delete:** Remove a section if it is no longer needed or relevant.
- **Reorder:** Change the order of sections within a board to adjust the layout and flow of content.

## Examples of Section Usage

- **SDG Challenges Section:** Use this section to group assignments related to global sustainability goals. Students can submit their work, track their progress, and receive feedback on their efforts.
- **Personal Reflection Section:** Students can post their reflections on their learning experiences, discuss challenges faced, and share insights gained throughout their projects.

Sections help in organizing and structuring the content within a board, making it easier for teachers and students to manage and interact with their assignments effectively.
