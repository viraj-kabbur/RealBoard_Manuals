# Adding Sections

In RealBoard, **Sections** are components within a Board that help categorize and organize content related to assignments, projects, or topics. Each board can contain multiple sections, each serving a specific purpose or focus area.

## Purpose of Sections

Sections are designed to:

1. **Categorize Content:** Organize different types of content or aspects of an assignment into distinct areas for better clarity and management.
2. **Enhance Organization:** Allow for a structured layout within a board, making it easier for students to find and work on specific tasks or assignments.
3. **Facilitate Specific Goals:** Target different types of activities or reflections, such as project milestones, personal reflections, or SDG challenges.

## Key Features of Sections

1. **Title:** Each section has a **Title**. The title describes the focus of the section.
2. **Examples of Sections:**
   * **SDG Challenges:** Sections focused on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where students can work on related challenges and document their progress.
   * **Personal Reflection:** Sections where students reflect on their learning experiences, share insights, and discuss their personal growth.
   * **Custom Sections:** Teachers/Professors can create custom sections to fit specific needs or assignments, such as group projects, research topics, or skill development.
