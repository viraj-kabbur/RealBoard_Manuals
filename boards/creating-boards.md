# Creating Boards

In RealBoard, **Boards** are the primary organizational structure used to manage and display assignments, projects, and student work. Each board is designed to hold various **Sections** that correspond to different aspects of the assignment or project.

## Purpose of Boards

Boards serve several key purposes:

1. **Organization:** Boards help organize multiple assignments or projects under one central location. Each board can focus on a particular subject, theme, or project.
2. **Assignment Management:** Teachers can use boards to group related assignments, track progress, and provide feedback.
3. **Student Interaction:** Students can use boards to submit their work, reflect on their learning experiences, and view their peers' contributions.

## Key Features of Boards

1. **Title and Description:** Each board has a **Title** and a **Description** to provide context and information about the assignments or projects it contains.
2. **Sections:** Boards are divided into **Sections** to further categorize and organize content. Sections can be customized and added as needed.
3. **Assignments:** Within each section, teachers can create and manage **Assignments**. Each assignment is linked to the relevant sections and boards.
4. **Student Cards:** Students can create **Cards** within sections to showcase their work, reflections, and screenshots related to the assignments.
