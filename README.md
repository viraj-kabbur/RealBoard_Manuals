# Overview

## <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Reflect, Share, Grow**</mark>

This tagline encapsulates the essence of what RealBoard offers to students, teachers/professors, and educational institutions. Let’s break down each element and how it ties into the core activities of the platform

### **Reflect**

* **Personal Reflection**: RealBoard encourages students to look back on their learning experiences and think critically about what they’ve learned. Through features like the "Personal Reflection" section, students can document their thoughts, insights, and feelings about the assignments they complete. This process not only reinforces learning but also helps in developing self-awareness and critical thinking skills.

### **Share**

* **Sharing Experiences**: RealBoard provides a platform where students can share their learning experiences with peers and teachers/professors. By using Cards to upload screenshots, write posts, and share achievements within specific sections like "SDG Challenges," students are able to communicate their progress and insights in a structured yet creative way.

### **Grow**

* **Personal and Academic Growth**: The combination of reflection and sharing leads to growth—both personally and academically. RealBoard is designed to help students track their progress over time, set personal goals, and see how their efforts translate into growth.
